  abstract = {Participation in international trade is a key indicator of an industry's competitiveness. This study presents a framework for measuring the export competitiveness of an industry across countries that takes into account (a) industry specialisation, measured by the revealed comparative advantage, (b) industry export growth rate and (c) relative industry size. The framework is applied to the alcoholic beverages industry using data from the top 30 exporters of alcoholic beverages over a five-year period (2001-2005). The results indicate that the alcohol beverage export market is dynamic and changing, and that export competitiveness varies by country according to the sub-sector of the industry. A discussion of the application of the framework across industries and countries follows. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

It has received attention from researchers, governments and business organizations because of its close association with the success of an entity. In the past decades, many works on competitiveness with different perspectives have been published. But competitiveness is yet an elusive concept, the relevance of which is changing with time. There is a need for a comprehensive review of extant literature on the subject. This review article presents the state-of-the-art development of competitiveness research. To begin with, the article lays the foundation for basic understanding on competitiveness at various levels, such as nation, industry and the firm. After elaborating on the theories of competitiveness that have evolved over the years, it gives insight on the measurement models. The plethora of studies that signify different approaches to measure competitiveness are discussed at length. The future direction of competitiveness research is also suggested.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The measures of the model are used for assessing the competitiveness of ten firms, in order to choose the most competitive firm of the year.

The aim of this paper is to analyze and evaluate the export competitiveness of Burgenland in relation to the foreign trade of Austria as a whole from 2010 to 2014, which is the period showing the highest increase in exports since the Iron Curtain fell. The Revealed Comparative Advantage index (RCA) was used to determine the development of the region's exports. The RCA index is used in international economics for calculating the relative advantage or disadvantage of a certain country in a certain class of goods or services. The findings show that Burgenland has important exports of agricultural products and that economic relationships with neighbouring countries are deepening. This study is an important contribution towards demonstrating the development of former Objective 1 area countries in the European Union.}

  abstract = {\textendash{} Twenty years ago, Senge's, 1990 pioneering article, ''The learning organization,'' published in MIT's Sloan Management Review, received center-stage attention. The concept received much support and was followed with articles by prominent writers and educators, Margaret Wheatley amongst them. Only ten years later, however, another prominent writer and educator, David Garvin, remarked, ``Learning organizations have been embraced in theory but are still surprisingly rare.'' The purpose of this paper is to argue and present support for a perspective that learning organizations have existed for over 100 years. Linking this concept to the past versus arguing that learning organizations are new will better pave the way for learning organizations to achieve a status of being more than simply ``embraced in theory.'', \textendash{} Three objectives were presented. The first developed an historical link, with the goal of showing that learning organizations have had a rich history and did not simply appear in 1990. The approach to the second was based on drawing implications from literature about the learning process. The very heart of competitiveness depends on how firm members experience the learning process. The process is a function of the use of tools (T) within a learning climate (C) and their interaction (T x C). The approach to the third objective was to conceptualize learning climate dimensions, old compared to new learning organizations., \textendash{} First, the idea that learning is always a competitiveness issue has not been consistently advanced in the literature, if hardly at all. Second, the internal learning climates within firms are what is at the heart of other cultures' successes. Much time has been spent studying the tools used in these firms, for instance quality circles, but little time with the climate learning dimension. The climate dimension has been the reason for their success., \textendash{} The paper presents a tools/climate learning dimensions matrix (a 2x2 matrix) and develops the understanding that all learning stems from two learning dimensions, tools, and the learning dimension, climate, within which the tools are employed. Within this discussion, the authors present the idea of the competitive advantage of cultures; this advantage appearing in a firm as a consequence of the ``climate learning dimension'' of various cultures. The concluding section of the paper presents five climate dimensions; those of yesterday compared with those of today. These well known management perspectives (e.g. single loop learning/double loop learning, independence/interdependence) are linked to the learning process with a special focus on the climate dimension of the process. It is there that the degree of the firm's competitiveness is enhanced.},

Economists, however, find it hard to believe that seemingly well-informed people can really be this naive, and assume that there must be more sophisticated ideas lying behind what they say. The rationales offered by economists, in turn, offer false comfort to the would-be sophisticates who like the term "competitiveness"; they believe that they have transcended conventional economic theory, when the fact is that they have failed to comprehend it.

In order to be competitive, firms are implementing new technologies such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), ERP II, and radio frequency identification to reduce the cost of doing business by improving operational efficiencies, establish better relationship with their business partners, as well as effectiveness by quickly responding to changes in the marketplace. Challenges and benefits of implementing these technologies by both manufacturing and service organizations are explored and examined in this paper., \textendash{} Low-cost and differentiation strategies require corporations to integrate information and communications technologies to streamline processes both within the firm and between business associates. A considerable amount of time and capital is required for acquisition and implementation of the new technology but the return on the investment is significant in the long run. Top management participation, change in management, and employee training are critical success factors in successful utilization of technology., \textendash{} The paper provides useful information with regards to the importance of technology in sustaining or gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace.},

It'll be described how users learn with others in Fab Labs, which are laboratories of digital fabrication, serving as prototyping platforms of physical objects, with broad educational, social and economic advantages. Its users can leverage their imagination and develop sustainable, social, local, economic innovative solutions to solve real problems, supported by tacit and explicit knowledge transfer. Seven semi structured interviews were performed with the Fab Managers of one Portuguese Lab, one Spanish Lab, one French Lab, one Italian Lab, and three Brazilian Labs. Interesting findings characterized the researched environments.},

International expansion was necessary for survival when foreign firms began to enter a domestic market, but only firms with substantial market share and international experience, gained prior to the industry transition, could expand successfully. Operating only in the home market may permit a firm to survive in a primarily domestic industry, but moderate international expansion often brings current benefits and provides a base for future success should the industry become more global. However, expansion carries the risk of failure: firms that retrench after expanding internationally disappear.},

This report explores what agricultural competitiveness means by using three different measures: market share, relative export advantage, and revealed competitiveness. Each measure has a special use. This analysis shows that the most competitive agricultural exporters are usually those with the least government intervention. It also shows that the United States is most competitive in agricultural commodities such as soybeans and coarse grains that receive relatively little government protection. This apparent conflict between competitiveness and protection suggests that openness makes markets perform better, increasing global economic efficiency.},

  abstract = {Competitiveness is one of the most misunderstood concepts of the 1990s. It has drawn substantial attention from the government and business communities during the last 25 years. Morrisson et al. (1988) noted that between 1983 and 1987, the term competitiveness appeared more than 5700 times in the titles of newspapers and magazine articles. The growth of importance and interest can also be observed from the increase in the bibliographical entries in ABI/Inform database. From 1981 to 1986, the topic ``international competitiveness'' increased by about 26 listings per year (a total of 159 in 6 years) and the rate increased to 45 listings per year from 1987 to 1993. Academic interest in the area has also increased and as a result, new developments contemplating conceptualization and understanding of competitiveness are taking place. However, to no one's surprise, writers from different disciplines offer a variation in perspective when describing the concept, understanding, and postulation of competitiveness.}
